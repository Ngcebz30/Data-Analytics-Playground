# Real Estate Insights in New York ðŸ—½

This project aims to provide insights into the short-term rental market in New York City. The project analyzed a dataset of Airbnb listings in NYC from 2019-2020 to uncover insights about the market, including which neighborhoods command the highest prices, what features are most important to guests, and how property managers can optimize their listings for success.

This is my first major project in data analysis, and I learned a lot from working on it. The directory includes the data analysis, a full business report, and this README.
